README - Foleys Video Engine
============================

Daniel Walz - developer@foleysfinest.com - 2019

Foleys Finest Audio Ltd.

With the module foleys_video_engine we offer a simple way to implement reading,
writing, displaying and editing of videos using the audio framework JUCE (https://juce.com)

To read and write video files it uses FFmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org). Alternative backends
like AVFoundation (OSX) or DirectShow (Windows) might follow in the future, but no
promises.

Examples
--------

On https://github.com/ffAudio/VideoExamples we have a simple video player using this engine,
as well as a Video Editor (NLE) to test the functionality and to give an idea about it's
intended use.

To use the engine, just start the Projucer and add foleys_video_engine to your project.

We hope this is useful and are looking forward to your feedback:
