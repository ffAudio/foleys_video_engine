 @class FilmStrip

 The FilmStrip allows to display a line of thumbnails of a video clip.
 Because it already uses the paint() and resized() hooks, you cannot inherit that.
 Instead put it into your Component, that you can decorate. The Filmstrip itself
 will not catch any mouse events, so you have still all flexibility by doing so.
