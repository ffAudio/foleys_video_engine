------------

Foleys Finest Audio welcomes feedback, suggestions and contributions. However, since
we offer the engine in under two different licenses, some specialities apply:

1.) We cannot accept pull requests without prior communication. This is not, because 
we don't appreciate your input, but because currently we own the copyright of the whole
codebase.

2.) The code is available as GPL, so feel free to fork and modify, fix, break in any
way you want. If you did something clever, we haven't thought of, feel free to get in 
touch!

3.) If you want to contribute code, please get in touch as well. To integrate it, we
will need you to waive your copyright, but we will find a way to show our gratitude.
Let's have a talk about it.
